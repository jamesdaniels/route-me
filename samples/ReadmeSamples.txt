This "samples" directory contains both sample code and engineering
test cases.

SampleMap is a straightforward example of the Route-me library in
action, using the Open Street Map project's map tiles, and retrieving
data from their server. Developers: please don't check in any code
that breaks this project.

MapTestbed is similar to SampleMap, but is meant as a starting point
for writing test cases. Developers are encouraged to clone the
MapTestbed project when testing new features or when trying to
duplicate bugs. If you make changes to MapTestbed to exercise a new
Route-me features, please check in your revised version under a new
name.
