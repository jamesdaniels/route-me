There are two subdirectories - MapView and Proj4. Proj4 is a support class used to do map projections. The MapView project contains both the route-me map library and a simple example application which embeds the map. Refer to the embedding guide for details: http://code.google.com/p/route-me/wiki/EmbedingGuide
