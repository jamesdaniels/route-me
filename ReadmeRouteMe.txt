There are three subdirectories - MapView, Proj4, and samples. Proj4 is a support class used to do map projections. The MapView project contains both the route-me map library and a simple example application which embeds the map. Refer to the embedding guide for details: http://code.google.com/p/route-me/wiki/EmbeddingGuide. "samples" contains some ready-to-build projects which you may use as starting points for your own applications.
